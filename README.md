## Description
The core functionality of this weather dashboard is to utilize the 5 Day Weather Forecast API for retrieving weather data for various cities. The user interface is clean, user-friendly, and responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes. Users can search for cities to get detailed weather forecasts, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more for the next five days.

This application not only serves as a practical tool for users to check weather conditions but also demonstrates the ability to effectively integrate and display data from an external source in a meaningful and visually appealing way. The dynamic nature of the content, powered by JavaScript, enhances the interactivity and real-time data presentation, making it a valuable resource for those needing up-to-date weather information.
